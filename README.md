## Overview

The Multi-operation Python Program (MUPP) is a versatile Python tool designed to perform a variety of common and potentially more specialized operations within a single, user-friendly interface. This program aims to simplify workflows by consolidating multiple functionalities into one script, reducing the need for separate tools for different tasks.

**Key Features:**

* **[List specific operations the program performs. Be detailed and use bullet points. For example:]**
    * **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
    * **String Manipulation:** Reversing strings, checking for palindromes, counting word occurrences.
    * **File Operations:** Reading from and writing to text files.
    * **Data Conversion:** Converting between different units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
    * **[Add any other unique or important features of your program]**
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a clear and intuitive way for users to select and execute desired operations.
* **Modular Design:** The program is structured in a way that makes it easy to add new operations in the future.
* **[Mention any other advantages, like efficiency, automation, etc.]**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** This program is written in Python 3 and requires it to be installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Aarya-Veer-Singh-0341/Multi-operation-python-program-MUPP.git](https://github.com/Aarya-Veer-Singh-0341/Multi-operation-python-program-MUPP.git)
    cd Multi-operation-python-program-MUPP
    ```

2.  **[Optional: If there are any dependencies that need to be installed, list them here. For example:]**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If your program doesn't have any external dependencies, you can remove this step and the `requirements.txt` file mention.)*

### Running the Program

To execute the MUPP program, simply run the main Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py  # Or whatever the main script file is named
